## Initialize GitHub Repository
This should be a fairly straightforward post. I created a public [repository](https://github.com/martinatime/podcast-manager). I'm not going through all aspects of setting up the repository. I set up this repo with the MIT license and added a .gitignore and a README.md.

## Initialize Spring Boot Application
Again this is fairly straightforward. I'm using the [Spring Initizlizr](https://start.spring.io/). I named the artifact "podcast-manager" and set it up for a Groovy build and used Java 17 for the application. I chose Groovy because I enjoy it and could have made the entire project using Groovy but the assessability of Java made me choose that for the main language. I added many dependencies prior to generating the application package but those will be reviewed as we start to use them.

I have cloned the repo locally, copied the files (including merging the two .gitignore files), committed and pushed the files up into the main branch as the first commit.
